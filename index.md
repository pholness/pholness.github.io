# GitHub Pages site for Peter Holness
## Introduction
Hi. I've set this site up primarily to check out what can be achieved with GitHub Pages. 

So it's not a complete waste of space, I'm intending to use the space to keep track of any little programming projects I'm playing with, and as a dumping ground for useful SQL and database stuff I use day to day.

Links to pages are in the side bar.
